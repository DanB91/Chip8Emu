This a CHIP-8 emulator which takes in a CHIP-8 program as input.

NOTE: DOES NOT SUPPORT SUPERCHIP OR MEGACHIP PROGRAMS.


Requirements:
	-CMake
	-SDL
	-ncurses
	-compiler that supports C++11 (gcc 4.7 or higher should do fine.  This will compile on OS X Mountain Lion)

Commands to compile compile:
	1) mkdir build
	2) cd build
	3) cmake ..
	4) make
	5) The executable's path will be "bin/ch8emu"

Program arguments:
	game: Path to the game to run.
	-d: Turns on the ncurses debug viewer and will log each cycle to "log.txt"
	-c cycles_per_second: Will make the emulator run at most "cycles_per_second" cycles per second.
